# snake-on-sdl
This is the game of Snake that I wrote in C++ with the use of SDL client code which is free to use for everyone. 
The game is pretty simple -- the snake eats its food, which in the game is represented as a green colored block. 
the snake's head is light brown and and the snake's body is black: this helps distinguish the head from the body with ease. 
I will keep updating this game periodically and try to improve the graphics.
